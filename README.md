# Ronin Gun
You are a runner and a gunner with a sword, fighting your way through the cybernetic world currently invaded by androids and drones. Slash and dash as long as you can and beware the barrels! Your sword is your short-range weapon paired with your blaster to shoot from afar. The yellow danger barrels with explode when you are within close proximity - use this to your advantage!
